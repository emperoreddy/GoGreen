# Go Green - _N-Able Hackathon project_ -


**The project was made in the N-Able Hackathon event, alongside my team, [Serban Corodescu](https://github.com/LowBudgetChaplin).**

**Beware, I haven't changed even a line of code after the hackathon so it will remain the same experience and file structure, even though it's awful. Thanks for understanding :>**

Helping children have a 'green' attitude from an early age is difficult, so we made a website on which everybody (but most important, children) can learn to make an impact by recycling into different containers and the usage of less non-biodegradable items.
The website contains an informative page with a interractive game.

### Rules of the game
* You need to catch the bottles into the container and get to 50 points to grow the tree to full-size
* The game will speed up after each bottle caught, making it harder
* Not catching the bottle will result in the game stopping, showing the score you've reached


### Utilised technologies
* _Vanilla_ JavaScript
* HTML5
* CSS
